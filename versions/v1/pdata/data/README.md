# Processed Data
This is the directory where the processed data will be stored. I did not add the processed csv files because they were large files. You can get the processed csv files by running the script.ipynb.

- *train.csv* for processed *dataset/train.csv*
- *test.csv* for processed *dataset/test.csv*

Names will be same but the directory will be different.
